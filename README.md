which makes this QWERTY keyboard smartphone a little more "keyboard"

# Keyboard shortcuts

* `SHIFT` (short press) - toggle SHIFT state or accept incoming call (disabled by default)
* `SHIFT` + `KEY` - print KEY in upper case
* `ALT` (short press) - toggle ALT state or decline incoming call (disabled by default)
* `ALT` + `KEY` - print KEY alternate value
* `ALT` + `SHIFT` or `SPACE` (hold) - switch to the next keyboard layout (input method)
* `CTRL` + `ALT` - launch voice input
* `CTRL` + `KEY` - some default CTRL shortcuts (e.g. `CTRL` + `V`)
* `SYM` (short press) - toggle emoji panel visibility
* `SYM` + `KEY` - run `SymPad` action
* `SYM` (hold) - enable and lock `SymPad` mode

_Tip:_ to enable incoming call accept/decline feature go to the PocketBoard settings, turn on `Phone control`
and grant the required permission

_Tip:_ to print an alternate key value, you can simply hold down that key

_Tip:_ some keys have more than one alternate (and main) value. You can iterate over these values by quickly pressing the key

## SymPad actions

`SymPad` is a keyboard mode that simulates additional hardware key events:

* `Q`, `W`, `E`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Z`, `X`, `C` or `I`, `O`, `P`, `K`, `L`, `Del`, `N`, `M`, `Ent` - 9-positional D-Pad
* `R` or `U` - Home
* `F` or `J` - End
* `V` - previous track (short press) or rewind (hold)
* `SPACE` - Play/Pause
* `B` - next track (short press) or fast forward (hold)

_Tip:_ to lock keyboard in `SymPad` mode you need to hold down the `SYM` key for about 2-3 seconds. When `SymPad` mode
lock is active, the `<S>` icon is displayed in the status bar. To back to normal mode just press `SYM` again.

_Tip:_ you can use `D-Pad`, `Home` and `End` keys simulation to move cursor in text fields, scroll through pages in the
browser, etc. Using `D-Pad` and `SHIFT` you can also select text in a text editor

_Notice:_ some modern applications don't support `D-Pad` events and many music/video player applications do not
support fast forward/rewind events

# Known bugs

* Digits duplication in Telegram login fields

  _Workaround:_ use additional symbols palette (press `SYM` and go to the `$` tab) to enter phone and confirmation number

  suggestion and everything should work as expected
